Templated linked list

Allows for different types of data to be stored in the list, rather than just integers
This makes this infinitely more useful than the regular list


Templated Singly Linked List

Doesnt require any external files, as all code is inside header, since it is a template class

Can do anything the non templated version can do and:
- Add **any** type of node into the list at any position
